### 🛑 CODING RULES
# 🚀 MVP CODING RULES (VELOCITY FIRST)

## PHILOSOPHY
- **Ship It:** Functionality > Perfection. Code cleanliness is secondary to working features.
- **YAGNI:** You Aren't Gonna Need It. Do not over-engineer or create abstractions for future use cases.

## STANDARDS
1. **Testing:** Only write tests for critical paths (e.g., Payments, Auth). Skip unit tests for UI components.
2. **Comments:** Only comment complex logic. Self-documenting code is preferred.
3. **Types:** Use `any` or loose typing if strict typing blocks progress for more than 5 minutes.
4. **Refactoring:** Postpone refactoring until after the feature is validated by users.
